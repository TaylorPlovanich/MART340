            <h2>Gallery Layout</h2>
            <p>The gallery layout is inspired by museum displays, with artworks grouped into three main sections: Interactive Works, Video Works, and Static Works. Each section is organized to encourage exploration, with podiums showcasing individual pieces. Interactive works are positioned near the start to engage viewers immediately, while video and static works are placed deeper into the layout to invite further discovery. This flow mirrors the progression of a real-world gallery experience.</p>
